Js has only 1 call stack. It is very fast. 
Can  achieve asyn for Js. Don't block main thread 

If you want to differ some code a code that is not important maybe some content on the 4th page do 


console.log("start")

function cb(){
    console.log("4th page content")
}

setTimeout(cb,0);

console.log("end ");
